# Yggdrasil Wars

*Yggdrasill Wars* is a multiplayer game where players will choose a character and pair up with other players to fight monsters that have began flooding the landscape. 

Every character has a unique ability that allows them to gain an advantage in battle. Use this wisely.

Sword too dull? Find a chest and pick the lock by typing the keys shown - there may be a useful item inside! However, some tricksters have left locked chests laying around with nothing in them... what a ruse!

**Note:** The game is in an unfinished state, mostly due to the university-provided databases no longer being "up". While monsters spawn and combat works, there is no end-game conditions implemented. The planned conditions were that enemy spawners could be "conquered" for your team. Once all were captured, each team gains points for every monster they've killed and every spawner they've conquered. The team with the most points would win and the world would restart.
