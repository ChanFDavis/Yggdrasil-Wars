Note: The game is in an unfinished state. While monsters spawn and combat works, there is no end-game conditions implemented. The planned conditions were that enemy spawners could be "conquered" for your team. Once all were captured, each team gains points for every monster they've killed and every spawner they've conquered. The team with the most points would win and the world would restart.
